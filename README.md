# NutriVision
## Anya Yerramilli, Veronica Starchenko, Elizabeth Song
Nutrition is an important aspect of every personâ€™s physical and even emotional health. However, cooking is intimidating and difficult for many people. Sometimes, it feels like a barrier or hurdle to go out and buy a lot of ingredients for one specific recipe. Instead, our users can use NutriVision to take a photo of their ingredients or enter them via text to receive recipes that the user can make in return. We will also take into account the volume of ingredients to analyze serving size, and offer interaction with a chatbot past generation of the recipe to discuss what ingredients a user should add for some nutrition goal (e.g. more of a certain vitamin, more protein, etc.) We will also do modification suggestions (allergies, disliked ingredients/meals, etc) that the app will remember for later.
