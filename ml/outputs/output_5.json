            "Prepare the flank steak: Trim any excess fat from the flank steak. Slice the steak thinly against the grain.",
            "Marinate the steak: In a bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, paprika, and cumin. Add the sliced steak and toss to coat. Let it marinate for at least 15 minutes while you prepare the other ingredients.",
            "Cook the arborio rice: Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the arborio rice and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently, until the rice is lightly toasted. Add the water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 18-20 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the water is absorbed. Set aside.",
            "Saut\u00e9 the carrots and chili peppers: While the rice is cooking, heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the diced carrots and minced chili peppers. Cook for 5-7 minutes, or until the carrots are slightly softened and the peppers are fragrant.",
            "Cook the beef: Add the marinated flank steak to the skillet with the carrots and peppers. Cook for 2-3 minutes per side, or until the beef is cooked to your desired doneness.",
            "Prepare the hoisin glaze: In a small bowl, whisk together the hoisin sauce (ensure gluten-free and soy-free).  Set aside.",
            "Assemble the bowls: Warm the refried beans in a microwave-safe bowl. Warm the tortillas as directed on the package.  To assemble each bowl, start with a base of arborio rice. Top with the refried beans, beef and carrot mixture. Drizzle with the hoisin glaze. Serve with the warm tortillas for wrapping the mixture."
